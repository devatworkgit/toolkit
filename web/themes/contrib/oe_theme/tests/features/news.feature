  Scenario: News information is shown in teasers.
    Given "oe_news" content:
      | title           | oe_summary    | oe_teaser   | body      | oe_publication_date | oe_subject                     | oe_author                                                               | oe_content_content_owner                                                |

    But I should not see the text "Short summary"
    And I should not see the text "News body"
    And I should not see an "list item image" element

    And I am logged in as a user with the "create oe_news content, access content, edit any oe_news content, view published skos concept entities, create image media" permission
